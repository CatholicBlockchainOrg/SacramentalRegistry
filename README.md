# Development Environment
As you develop and support different applications with node you'll find the need to flip back and forth between
different versions of node to support those apps. One of the best tools that supports this is [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
Instead of installing node directly on your machine install nvm. Then use that to install node.
